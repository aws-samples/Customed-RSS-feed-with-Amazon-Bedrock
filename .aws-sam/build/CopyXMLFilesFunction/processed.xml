			<title>Amazon API Gateway integration timeout limit increase beyond 29 seconds</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/06/amazon-api-gateway-integration-timeout-limit-29-seconds/</link>
			<description>Amazon API Gateway now enables customers to increase their integration timeout beyond the prior limit of 29 seconds. This setting represents the maximum amount of time API Gateway will wait for a response from the integration to complete. You can raise the integration timeout to greater than 29 seconds for Regional REST APIs and private REST APIs, but this might require a reduction in your account-level throttle quota limit. With this launch, customers with workloads requiring longer timeouts, such as Generative AI use cases with Large Language Models (LLMs), can leverage API Gateway. Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the &quot;front door&quot; for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications. This new capability to increase integration timeout limits for Regional and private REST APIs is available in all AWS Regions at no additional cost. To learn more, see API Gateway documentation.</description>

			<title>Amazon CloudFront launches support for JA4 fingerprinting</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-cloudfront-ja4-fingerprinting/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon CloudFront now supports JA4 fingerprinting of incoming requests, enabling customers to allow known clients or block requests from malicious clients. The JA4 fingerprint is passed via the Cloudfront-viewer-ja4-fingerprint header. You can inspect the JA4 fingerprints using custom logic on your application web servers or using CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A JA4 TLS client fingerprint contains a 38-character long fingerprint of the TLS Client Hello which is used to initiate a secure connection from clients. The fingerprint can be used to build a database of known good and bad actors to apply when inspecting HTTP requests. You can add the Cloudfront-viewer-ja4-fingerprint header to an origin request policy and attach the policy to your CloudFront distributions. You can then inspect the header value on your application web servers or in your Lambda@Edge and CloudFront Functions to compare the header value against a list of known malware fingerprints to block malicious clients. You can also compare the header value against a list of expected fingerprints to allow only requests bearing the expected fingerprints.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cloudfront-viewer-ja4-fingerprint headers are available for immediate use in all CloudFront edge locations. You can enable JA4 fingerprint headers in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home#/policies/responseHeaders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CloudFront Console&lt;/a&gt; or using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS SDK&lt;/a&gt;. There are no additional fees to use JA4 fingerprint headers. For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-cloudfront-headers.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CloudFront Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS Resource Explorer introduces new API to list resource inventory</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-resource-explorer-api-list-resource-inventory/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Resource Explorer customers can now list all AWS resources indexed by Resource Explorer across Services, AWS Regions, and AWS accounts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Customers use Resource Explorer to search for supported AWS resources using keywords and search operators to return up to 1,000 relevancy-ranked results. Starting today, customers can use the same familiar search operators to list and paginate through all matching results with Resource Explorer’s new ListResources API. The ListResources API is available in the AWS SDKs and CLI.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more about this capability, please visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/apireference/API_ListResources.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This feature is available in all AWS Commercial Regions.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Cross-zone enabled Network Load Balancer now supports zonal shift and zonal autoshift</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/cross-zone-network-load-balancer-zonal-shift-autoshift/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) now supports Amazon Application Recovery Controller’s zonal shift and zonal autoshift features on load balancers that are enabled across zones. Zonal shift allows you to quickly shift traffic away from an impaired Availability Zone (AZ) and recover from events such as bad application deployment and gray failures. Zonal autoshift safely and automatically shifts your traffic away from an AZ when AWS identifies potential impact to it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Enabling cross-zone on NLBs is a popular configuration for customers that require an even distribution of traffic across application targets in multiple AZs. With this launch, customers can shift traffic away from an AZ in the event of a failure just like they are able to for cross-zone disabled load balancers. When zonal shift or autoshift is triggered, the NLB will block all traffic to targets in the AZ that is impacted. You can configure this feature in two steps: First, enable configuration to allow zonal shift to act on your load balancer(s) using the NLB console or API. Second, trigger zonal shift or enable zonal autoshift for the chosen NLBs via Amazon Application Recovery Controller console or API.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Zonal shift and zonal autoshift support on NLB is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all commercial AWS Regions&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS GovCloud (US) Regions&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/zonal-shift.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NLB zonal shift documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Redshift introduces query identifiers for improved query performance monitoring</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-redshift-query-identifiers-performance-monitoring</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Redshift introduces a unique identifier assigned to SQL queries, which lets you effectively track query performance over time and identify recurring patterns in resource-intensive queries. This new feature, called a 'query hash', uniquely identifies SQL queries based on their textual representation and predicate values.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Query hash is a unique query signature that is generated for executed queries on a data warehouse. With query hash, you can investigate query performance by either performing trend analysis of queries over a period of time or comparing performance for a query across different time periods. This feature adds two new columns to SYS_QUERY_HISTORY view: user_query_hash, a hash with query literals, and generic_query_hash, the hash without query literals.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon Redshift query hash is now generally available for both Amazon Redshift provisioned clusters and Amazon Redshift Serverless data warehouses in all AWS commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where Amazon Redshift is available. To get started and learn more, visit the Amazon Redshift &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/SYS_QUERY_HISTORY.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;database developer guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Amazon EventBridge Schema Registry and Schema Discovery service is now available in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, allowing you to discover and store event structure - or schema - in a shared, central location. You can download code bindings for those schemas for Java, Python, Typescript, and Golang so it’s easier to use events as objects in your code.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Schema Discovery and Schema Registry features are integrated with the Amazon EventBridge Event Bus, which enables you to create scalable event-driven applications by routing events between your own applications, third-party SaaS applications, and other AWS services. While event buses decouple your event sources and event targets, letting your teams act more independently, the Schema Registry enables your teams to share the structures of the events they are publishing so that other teams can discover and create integrations incorporating their events.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can have the Schema Registry centrally store schemas by adding them to the registry yourself or by turning on the Schema Discovery feature to automatically discover and store schemas from events sent to an event bus. By generating code bindings, you can interact with the event as an object in your code, using your preferred IDE to take advantage of features like code validation and auto-completion.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more about Amazon EventBridge, please visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-schema.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; or get started in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://console.aws.amazon.com/events/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS Lambda now detects and stops recursive loops between Lambda and Amazon S3</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-lambda-detects-stops-recursive-loops-lambda-s3/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Lambda recursive loop detection can now automatically detect and stop recursive loops between &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon S3). Lambda recursive loop detection, which is enabled by default, is a preventative guardrail that automatically detects and stops recursive invocations between Lambda and other supported services, preventing unintended usage and billing from runaway workloads.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Customers commonly use Amazon S3 as an event source to trigger Lambda functions. Customer misconfiguration or code defect can cause processed events to be sent back to the same Amazon S3 bucket that invoked the Lambda function, causing unintended recursive loops. Now, Lambda will automatically detect and stop such recursive loops and send customers an AWS Health Dashboard notification with troubleshooting steps.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; S3 support for recursive loop detection is available in all regions where Lambda recursive loop detection is available. If your function uses intentional recursive loops,&amp;nbsp;you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_PutFunctionRecursionConfig.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PutFunctionRecursionConfig API &lt;/a&gt;to turn off recursive loop detection.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more about Lambda recursive loop detection, please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-recursion.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lambda documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver introduces new access controls for individual Kubernetes pods</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/mountpoint-amazon-s3-csi-driver-access-controls-kubernetes-pods</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Mountpoint for Amazon S3 Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver now supports configuring distinct &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/iam/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)&lt;/a&gt; roles for individual Kubernetes pods. Built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/mountpoint/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mountpoint for Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt;, the CSI driver presents an S3 bucket as a volume accessible by containers in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and self-managed Kubernetes clusters. Now, you can use IAM roles for each pod to restrict access to specific buckets or objects, without making changes to your applications.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Previously, you could configure an IAM role that the CSI driver used for all pods in your Kubernetes cluster. With this launch, you can further strengthen your application security when building multi-tenant environments by configuring the CSI driver to use individual IAM roles for each pod that attaches a volume. This means that you can run data-intensive jobs, like machine learning or media transcoding, across multiple pods while allowing each pod to access only the data it needs, providing data isolation between pods as a result.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon EKS supports the Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver as an EKS add-on. You can install, configure, and update the CSI driver with just a few clicks in the Amazon EKS console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), EKS Application Programming Interface (API), and AWS CloudFormation. To get started, follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/s3-csi.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS CodePipeline introduces new general purpose compute action</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-codepipeline-general-purpose-compute-action/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS CodePipeline introduces the Commands action that enables you to easily run shell commands as part of your pipeline execution. With the Commands action, you will have access to a secure compute environment backed by CodeBuild to run AWS CLI, third-party tools, or any shell commands. The Commands action runs CodeBuild managed on-demand EC2 compute, and uses an Amazon Linux 2023 standard 5.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/ec2-compute-images.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Previously, if you wanted to run AWS CLI commands, third-party CLI commands, or simply invoke an API, you had to create a CodeBuild project, configure the project with the appropriate commands, and add a CodeBuild action to your pipeline to run the project. Now, you can simply add the Commands action to your pipeline, and define one or more commands as part of the action configuration. Since Commands is like any other CodePipeline action, you can use the standard CodePipeline features of input / output artifacts and output variables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more about using the Commands action in your pipeline, visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/action-reference-Commands.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. For more information about AWS CodePipeline, visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;. The Commands action is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all regions &lt;/a&gt;where AWS CodePipeline is supported.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Route 53 Resolver endpoints now support DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) with Server Name Indication (SNI) validation</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-route-53-resolver-endpoints-doh-sni-validation</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting today, you can provide Server Name Indication (SNI) with Route 53 Resolver endpoints for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), allowing you to specify the target server hostname for DNS query requests from your outbound endpoints to DoH servers that require SNI for TLS validation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; DoH on Amazon Route 53 Resolver endpoints allows you to encrypt DNS queries that pass through the endpoints and improve privacy by minimizing the visibility of the information exchanged through the queries. With this launch, you can now specify the hostname with your outbound endpoint configuration to perform TLS handshakes for your DNS requests from the outbound endpoints to the DoH server. Enabling SNI validation for your DoH Resolver endpoints also helps you meet regulatory and business compliance requirements, such as those described in the memorandum of the US Oﬃce of Management and Budget, where outbound DNS traffic must be be addressed to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Protective DNS that require SNI hostname validation for a successful TLS handshake.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Resolver endpoints support for DoH with SNI is available in all Regions where Route 53 is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Region Table&lt;/a&gt; to see all AWS Regions where Amazon Route 53 is available.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can get started by using the AWS Console or Route 53 API. For more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/route53/resolver/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Route 53 Resolver product detail page&lt;/a&gt; and service &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Amazon WorkSpaces now supports file transfer between WorkSpaces sessions and local devices</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-workspaces-file-transfer-sessions-local-devices/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon WorkSpaces is launching support for transferring files between a WorkSpaces Personal session and a local computer. This helps customers to manage and share files seamlessly, increasing their productivity. This is supported on personal WorkSpaces that use the DCV streaming protocol when using the Windows, Linux client applications or web access.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With this launch, users can streamline their workflows and have easier ways to organize, manage, edit, and share files across their devices and platforms. The files on the WorkSpaces will be saved in a persistent storage folder. Amazon WorkSpaces also offers robust security measures, and administrators can control whether users can upload or download files from WorkSpaces to protect the data security of your organization.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This functionality is now available in all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/azs-workspaces.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon WorkSpaces Personal is available. There are no additional WorkSpaces costs for using the file transfer functionality. However, the files uploaded consume user volume that is attached to the WorkSpaces. Customers can increase the size of the user volumes attached to WorkSpaces at any time. Changing the volume size of a WorkSpace will effect the billing rate. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces-family/workspaces/pricing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon WorkSpaces pricing&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To get started on the WorkSpaces file transfer function, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/group_policy.html#gp_configurations_dcv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Configure file transfer for DCV WorkSpaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon EC2 now supports Optimize CPUs post instance launch</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-ec2-optimize-cpus-post-instance-launch/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 now allows customers to modify an instance’s CPU options after launch. You can now modify the number of vCPUs and/or disable the hyperthreading of a stopped EC2 instance to save on vCPU-based licensing costs. In addition, an instance’s CPU options are now maintained when changing its instance type.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Optimize CPUs feature allows customers to disable hyperthreading and reduce the number of vCPUs on an instance, resulting in a high memory to vCPU ratio helping customers save the vCPU-based licensing costs. This is particularly beneficial to customers who Bring-Your-Own-license (BYOL) for commercial database workloads, like Microsoft SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get started, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CPU options&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Amazon EC2 User Guide&lt;/em&gt;. To learn more about the new API, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon EC2 API Reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS IoT Core removes TLS ALPN requirement and adds custom authorizer capabilities</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-iot-core-tls-alpn-requirement-custom-authorizer-capabilities</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS IoT Core&lt;/a&gt; announces three new capabilities for domain configurations. Devices no longer need to rely on Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension to determine authentication type and protocol. Furthermore, developers can add additional X.509 client certificates validation to custom authentication workflow. Previously, devices selected authentication type by connecting to a defined port and providing TLS ALPN with chosen protocol. The new capability to configure authentication type and protocol purely based on the TLS Server Name Indication&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(SNI) extension makes it simpler to connect devices to the cloud without requiring TLS ALPN. This enables developers to migrate existing device fleets to AWS IoT Core without firmware updates or Amazon-specific TLS ALPN strings. The authentication type and protocol combination will be assigned to an endpoint for all supported TCP ports of this custom domain.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Building on the above-mentioned feature, AWS IoT Core added two additional authentication capabilities. Custom Authentication with X.509 Client Certificates allows customers to authenticate IoT devices using X.509 certificates and then add custom authentication logics as an additional layer of security check. Secondly, Custom Client Certificate Validation allows customers to validate X.509 client certificate based on a custom Lambda function. For example, developers can build custom certificate revocation checks, such as, Online Certificate Status Protocol and Certificate Revocation List, before allowing a client to connect.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All three capabilities are available in all AWS regions where AWS IoT Core is present, except AWS GovCloud (US). Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;developer guide&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about this feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 now supports up to 256 ACUs</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-aurora-serverless-v2-256-acus/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora Serverless v2&lt;/a&gt; now supports database capacity of up to 256 Aurora Capacity Units (ACUs). Aurora Serverless v2 measures capacity in ACUs where each ACU is a combination of approximately 2 gibibytes (GiB) of memory, corresponding CPU, and networking. You specify the capacity range and the database scales within this range to support your application’s needs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With higher maximum capacity, customers can now use Aurora Serverless for even more demanding workloads. Instead of scaling up to 128 ACUs (256 GiB), the database can now scale up to 256 ACUs (512 GiB). You can get started with higher capacity with a new cluster or your existing cluster with just a few clicks in the AWS Management console. For a new cluster, select the desired capacity for the maximum capacity setting. For existing clusters, select modify and update the maximum capacity setting. For existing incompatible instances that don’t allow capacity higher than 128 ACUs, add a new reader with the higher capacity to the existing cluster and failover to it. 256 ACUs is supported for Aurora PostgreSQL 13.13+, 14.10+, 15.5+, 16.1+, and Aurora MySQL 3.06+.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, automatic scaling configuration for &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora&lt;/a&gt;. It adjusts capacity in fine-grained increments to provide just the right amount of database resources for an application’s needs.

			<title>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus now supports Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-managed-service-prometheus-ipv6/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus now offers customers the option to use Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addresses for their new and existing workspaces. Customers moving to IPv6 can simplify their network stack by running and operating their Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspaces on a network that supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring service that makes it easy to monitor and alarm on operational metrics at scale. Prometheus is a popular Cloud Native Computing Foundation open-source project for monitoring and alerting on metrics from compute environments such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/eks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The continued growth of the internet is exhausting available Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses. IPv6 increases the number of available addresses by several orders of magnitude so customers will no longer need to manage overlapping address spaces in their VPCs. Customers can now connect to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus APIs with IPv6 connections. Customers can also continue to connect to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus APIs via IPv4 connections if they do not utilize IPv6.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more on best practices for configuring IPv6 in your environment, visit the whitepaper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/ipv6-on-aws/internet-protocol-version-6.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IPv6 in AWS&lt;/a&gt;. Support for IPv6 on Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is available in all regions where the service is GA. To learn more about Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/what-is-Amazon-Managed-Service-Prometheus.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now supports BYOIP and BYOASN in all AWS Local Zones</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-byoip-byoasn-local-zones/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting today, Amazon VPC supports two key public IP address management features, Bring-Your-Own-IP (BYOIP) and Bring-Your-Own-ASN (BYOASN), in all AWS Local Zones. If your applications use trusted IP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) that your customers or partners have allowed in their networks, you can run these applications in AWS Local Zones without requiring your partners or customers to change their allow-lists.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The reachability of many workloads, including host-managed VPNs, proxies, and telecommunication network functions, depends on an organization’s IP address and ASN. With BYOIP, you can now assign your public IPs to workloads in AWS Local Zones, and with BYOASN, you can advertise them using your own ASN. This ensures your workloads remain reachable by customers or partners that have allowlisted your IP addresses and ASN.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The BYOIP and BYOASN features are available in all &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/locations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Local Zones&lt;/a&gt;, and all AWS Regions except China (Beijing, operated by Sinnet) and China (Ningxia, operated by NWCD).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For more information about this feature, review the EC2 BYOIP &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and IPAM &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-ipam.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Redshift launches RA3.large instances</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-redshift-ra3-large</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Redshift launches RA3.large, a new smaller size in the RA3 node type with 2 vCPU and 16 GiB memory. You can now benefit from RA3.large as it gives more flexibility in compute options to choose from based on your workload requirements.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon Redshift RA3.large offers all the innovation of Redshift Managed Storage (RMS), including scaling and paying for compute and storage independently, data sharing, write operations support for concurrency scaling, Zero-ETL, and Multi-AZ. Along with already available sizes in the RA3 node type, RA3.16xlarge, RA3.4xlarge and RA3.xlplus, now with the introduction of RA3.large, you have even more compute sizing options to choose from to address the diverse workload and price performance requirements.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To get started with RA3.large, you can create a cluster with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/home?region=us-east-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Management Console&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCluster.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create cluster API&lt;/a&gt;. To upgrade cluster from your Redshift DC2 environment to an RA3 cluster, you can take a snapshot of your existing cluster and restore it to an RA3 cluster, or do a resize from your existing cluster to a new RA3 cluster. To learn more about the RA3 node type, see the cluster management guide and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-cluster-considerations.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;’Upgrading to RA3 node type’&lt;/a&gt; documentation. You can find more information on pricing by visiting the Amazon Redshift &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pricing page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; RA3.large is generally available in all commercial regions where the RA3 node type is available.

			<title>AWS announces Reserved Nodes flexibility for Amazon ElastiCache</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-reserved-nodes-flexibility-amazon-elasticache</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we’re announcing enhancements to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/reserved-cache-nodes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon ElastiCache Reserved Nodes&lt;/a&gt; that make them flexible and easier to use, helping you get the most out of your reserved nodes discount. Reserved nodes provide you with a significant discount compared to on-demand node prices, enabling you to optimize costs based on your expected usage.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Previously, you needed to purchase a reservation for a specified node type (e.g. cache.r7g.xlarge) and would only be eligible for a discount on the given type with no flexibility. With this feature, ElastiCache reserved nodes offer size flexibility within an instance family (or node family) and AWS region. This means that your existing discounted reserved node rate will be applied automatically to usage of all sizes in the same node family. For example, if you purchase a r7g.xlarge reserved node and need to scale to a larger node such as r7g.2xlarge, your reserved node discounted rate is automatically applied to 50% usage of the r7g.2xlarge node in the same AWS Region. The size flexibility capability will reduce the time that you need to spend managing your reserved nodes. With this feature, you can get the most out of your discount even if your capacity needs change.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon ElastiCache reserved node size flexibility is available in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions. To learn more, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon ElastiCache&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ElastiCache user guides&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/new-size-flexibility-for-amazon-elasticache-reserved-nodes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS Chatbot adds support to centrally manage access to AWS accounts from Slack and Microsoft Teams with AWS Organizations</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-chatbot-centrally-manage-access-accounts-slack-microsoft-teams-organizations</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS announces general availability of AWS Organizations support in AWS Chatbot. AWS customers can now centrally govern access to their accounts from Slack and Microsoft Teams with AWS Organizations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This launch introduces chatbot management policy type in AWS Organizations to control access to your organization's accounts from chat channels. Using Service Control Policies (SCPs), customers can also globally enforce permission limits on CLI commands originating from chat channels.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With this launch, customers can use chatbot policies and multi-account management services in AWS Organizations to determine which permissions models, chat applications, and chat workspaces can be used to access their accounts. For example, you can restrict access to production accounts from chat channels in designated workspaces/teams. Customers can also use SCPs to specify guardrails on the CLI command tasks executed from chat channels. For example, you can specify deny all rds: delete-db-cluster CLI actions originating from chat channels.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; AWS Organizations support in AWS Chatbot is available at no additional cost in all &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/a&gt; where AWS Chatbot is offered.

			<title>Amazon EMR Serverless introduces Job Run Concurrency and Queuing controls</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-emr-serverless-job-run-concurrency-queuing-controls/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/emr/serverless/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon EMR Serverless&lt;/a&gt; is a serverless option in Amazon EMR that makes it simple for data engineers and data scientists to run open-source big data analytics frameworks without configuring, managing, and scaling clusters or servers. Today, we are excited to announce job run admission control on Amazon EMR Serverless with support for job run concurrency and queuing controls.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Job run concurrency and queuing enables you to configure the maximum number of concurrent job runs for an application and automatically queues all other submitted job runs. This prevents job run failures caused when API limits are exceeded due to a spike in job run submissions or when resources are exhausted either due to an account or application's maximum concurrent vCPUs limit or an underlying subnet's IP address limit being exceeded. Job run queuing also simplifies job run management by eliminating the need to build complex queuing management systems to retry failed jobs due to limit errors (e.g., maximum concurrent vCPUs, subnet IP address limits etc.). With this feature, jobs are automatically queued and processed as concurrency slots become available, ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing job failures.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon EMR Serverless job run concurrency and queuing is available in all AWS Regions where AWS EMR Serverless is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and excluding China regions. To learn more, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/applications-concurrency-queuing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Job concurrency and queuing&lt;/a&gt; in the EMR Serverless documentation.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>NICE DCV renames to Amazon DCV and releases version 2024.0 with support for Ubuntu 24.04</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/nice-dcv-amazon-dcv-20240-ubuntu-2404/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon announces DCV version 2024.0. In this latest release, NICE DCV has been renamed to Amazon DCV. The new DCV version introduces several enhancements, including support for Ubuntu 24.04 and enabling the QUIC UDP protocol by default. Amazon DCV is a high-performance remote display protocol designed to help customers securely access remote desktop or application sessions, including 3D graphics applications hosted on servers with high-performance GPUs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon DCV version 2024.0 introduces the following updates, features, and improvements:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Renames to Amazon DCV. NICE DCV is now renamed as Amazon DCV. Additionally, Amazon has consolidated the WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol (WSP), used in Amazon WorkSpaces, with Amazon DCV. The renaming does not affect customer workloads, and there is no change to folder paths and internal tooling names.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Supports Ubuntu 24.04, the latest LTS version of Ubuntu with the latest security patches and updates, providing improved stability and reliability. Additionally, the DCV client on Ubuntu 24.04 now natively supports Wayland, providing better performance through more efficient graphical rendering.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Enables the QUIC UDP protocol by default, allowing end users to receive an optimized streaming experience.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Adds the ability to blank the Linux host screen when a remote user is connected to the Linux server in a console session, preventing users physically present near the server from seeing the screen and interacting with the remote session using the input devices connected to the host.&lt;/li&gt;

			<title>Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases now provides option to stop ingestion jobs</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-stop-ingestion-jobs/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is announcing the general availability of the stop ingestion API. This new API offers you greater control over data ingestion workflows by allowing you to stop an ongoing ingestion job that you no longer want to continue.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Earlier, you had to wait for the full completion of an ingestion job, even in cases where you no longer desired to ingest from the data source or needed to make other adjustments. With the introduction of the new &quot;StopIngestionJob&quot; API, you can now stop an in-progress ingestion job with a single API call. For example, you can use this feature to quickly stop an ingestion job you accidentally initiated, or if you want to change the documents in your data source. This enhanced flexibility enables you to rapidly respond to changing requirements and optimize your costs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This new capability is available across all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-supported.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more about stopping ingestion jobs and the other capabilities of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Data Firehose delivers data streams into Apache Iceberg format tables in Amazon S3</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-data-firehose-data-streams-iceberg-format-tables-s3/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Data Firehose&lt;/a&gt; (Firehose) can now deliver data streams into Apache Iceberg tables in Amazon S3.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Firehose enables customers to acquire, transform, and deliver data streams into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, OpenSearch, Splunk, Snowflake, and other destinations for analytics. With this new feature, Firehose integrates with Apache Iceberg, so customers can deliver data streams directly into Apache Iceberg tables in their Amazon S3 data lake. Firehose can acquire data streams from Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon MSK, or Direct PUT API, and is also integrated to acquire streams from AWS Services such as AWS WAF web ACL logs, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, AWS IOT, Amazon SNS, AWS API Gateway Access logs and many others listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/create-name.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Customers can stream data from any of these sources directly into Apache Iceberg tables in Amazon S3, and avoid multi-step processes. Firehose is serverless, so customers can simply setup a stream by configuring the source and destination properties, and pay based on bytes processed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The new feature also allows customers to route records in a data stream to different Apache Iceberg tables based on the content of the incoming record. To route records to different tables, customers can configure routing rules using JSON expressions. Additionally, customers can specify if the incoming record should apply a row-level update or delete operation in the destination Apache Iceberg table, and automate processing for data correction and right to forget scenarios.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To get started, visit Amazon Data Firehose &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/apache-iceberg-destination.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/pricing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/firehose/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon MSK APIs now supports AWS PrivateLink</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-msk-apis-aws-privatelink/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) APIs now come with &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS PrivateLink&lt;/a&gt; support, allowing you to invoke Amazon MSK APIs from within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without traversing the public internet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; By default, all communication between your Apache Kafka clients and your Amazon MSK provisioned clusters is private, and your data never traverses the internet. With this launch, clients can also invoke MSK APIs via a private endpoint. This allows client applications with strict security requirements to perform MSK specific actions, such as fetching bootstrap connection strings or describing cluster details, without needing to communicate over a public connection .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; AWS PrivateLink support for Amazon MSK is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon MSK is available. To get started, follow the directions provided in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS PrivateLink documentation&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) now supports HTTPS for tracking open and click events when using custom domains. Using HTTPS helps meet security compliance requirements and reduces the chances of email delivery issues with mailbox providers that reject non-secure links. The new feature provides the flexibility to configure HTTPS as mandatory for both open and click tracking, or make it optional based on the protocol of the links in your email.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Previously, HTTPS was only available for click event tracking with custom domains. If you required HTTPS for tracking&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;both open and clicks events, you were limited to the default tracking approach where the links in your emails were&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;wrapped with an Amazon-provided domain that immediately redirected recipients to the intended destination. Now, you can secure the tracking of both open and click events while providing a trustworthy and branded experience for your recipients by using your own custom domain. This can help increase deliverability metrics and protect your sender reputation by isolating it from the reputation of other senders.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can enable HTTPS for open and click tracking with custom domains in all &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon SES is offered.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more, see the Amazon SES documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/configure-custom-open-click-domains.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;configuring custom domains for open and click tracking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Announcing sample-based partitioning for AWS HealthOmics variant stores</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/sample-based-partitioning-healthomics-variant-stores/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that AWS HealthOmics variant stores are now optimized to improve sample based queries saving time and query costs for customers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/healthomics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS HealthOmics&lt;/a&gt; helps customers accelerate scientific breakthroughs by providing a fully managed service designed to handle bioinformatics and drug discovery workflows and storage at any scale. With this release, any new variant stores customer create will be automatically partitioned by the sample.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This feature automatically partitions data loaded into a variant store by the sample information. Because of this partitioning, any analysis that includes sample level filtering no longer needs to scan the full set of data leading to a lower query cost and faster results. Sample based queries are common when using clinical outcome or phenotypic information to perform filtering.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Sample partitioning is now supported for all new variant stores created in all regions where AWS HealthOmics is available: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Israel (Tel Aviv). To get started using the variant store, see the AWS HealthOmics &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/omics-analytics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Redshift announces mTLS support for Amazon MSK</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-redshift-mtls-amazon-msk/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Redshift streaming ingestion already supports Amazon IAM authentication and with this announcement, we are now extending authentication methods with the addition of mutual transport layer security (mTLS) authentication between Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster or serverless workgroup and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) cluster or serverless.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; mTLS is an industry standard for authentication that provides the means for a server to authenticate a client it's sending information to, and for the client to authenticate the server. The benefit of using mTLS is to provide a trusted authentication method that relies on each party (client &amp;amp; server) exchanging a certificate issued by mutually trusted certificate authorities. This is a common requirement for compliance reasons in a variety of applications in several industries, e.g., financial, retail, government and healthcare industries.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; mTLS authentication is available starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/cluster-versions.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Redshift patch 184 release&lt;/a&gt; in all AWS regions where Amazon Redshift and Amazon MSK are currently available. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS service availability by region&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more about using mTLS authentication with Amazon Redshift streaming, please refer to the Amazon MSK and mTLS sub-sections of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-streaming-ingestion-mtls.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Redshift streaming documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Aurora MySQL now supports RDS Data API</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-aurora-mysql-rds-data-api/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora&lt;/a&gt; MySQL-Compatible Edition now supports a redesigned RDS Data API for Aurora Serverless v2 and Aurora provisioned database instances. You can now access these Aurora clusters via a secure HTTP endpoint and run SQL statements without the use of database drivers and without managing connections. This follows the launch of Data API for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition for Aurora Serverless v2 and Aurora provisioned database instances last year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Data API was originally only available for single instance Aurora Serverless v1 clusters with a 1,000 request per second (RPS) rate limit. Based on customer feedback, Data API has now been redesigned for increased scalability. Data API will not impose a rate limit on requests made to Aurora Serverless v2 and Aurora provisioned clusters.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Data API eliminates the use of drivers and improves application scalability by automatically pooling and sharing database connections (connection pooling) rather than requiring customers to manage connections. Customers can call Data API via AWS SDK and CLI. Data API also enables access to Aurora databases via AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs. API commands supported in the redesigned Data API are backwards compatible with Data API for Aurora Serverless v1 for easy customer application migrations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Data API supports Aurora MySQL 3.07 and higher versions in 14 regions. Customers currently using Data API for Aurora Serverless v1 are encouraged to migrate to Aurora Serverless v2 to take advantage of the redesigned Data API. To learn more, read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS Lambda now supports SnapStart for Java functions in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/aws-lambda-snapstart-java-functions-govcloud/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting today, AWS Lambda SnapStart for Java functions is generally available in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. AWS Lambda SnapStart for Java delivers up to 10x faster function startup performance at no extra cost, making it easier for you to build highly responsive and scalable Java applications using AWS Lambda without having to provision resources or spend time and effort implementing complex performance optimizations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For latency sensitive applications where you want to support unpredictable bursts of traffic, high and outlier startup latencies—known as cold starts—can cause delays in your users’ experience. Lambda SnapStart offers improved startup times by initializing the function’s code ahead of time, taking a snapshot of the initialized execution environment, and caching it. When the function is invoked and subsequently scales up, Lambda SnapStart resumes new &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;execution environments&lt;/a&gt; from the cached snapshot instead of initializing them from scratch, significantly improving startup latency. Lambda SnapStart is ideal for applications such as synchronous APIs, interactive microservices, or data processing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can activate SnapStart for new or existing Java-based Lambda functions running on Amazon Corretto 11, 17, and 21 using the AWS Lambda API, AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS CloudFormation, AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), AWS SDK, and AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For more information on Lambda SnapStart, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-accelerate-your-lambda-functions-with-lambda-snapstart/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launch blog post&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more about Lambda, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lambda developer guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS announces general availability for Security Group Referencing on AWS Transit Gateway</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/general-availability-security-group-referencing-aws-transit-gateway</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS announces the general availability for Security Group Referencing across VPCs connected by the AWS Transit Gateway. With this capability, customers can simplify management of Security Groups and gain a better security posture for their TGW based networks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Customers can configure Security Groups by specifying a list of rules that allow network traffic based on criteria such as IP CIDRs, Prefix-Lists, Ports and SG references. Until now, customers were not able to use SG references for controlling traffic between VPCs connected via TGW. Security Group Referencing allows customers to specify other SGs as references, or matching criterion in inbound security rules to allow instance-to-instance traffic. With this capability, customers do not need to reconfigure security rules as applications scale up or down or if their IP addresses change. Rules with SG references also provide higher scale as a single rule can cover thousands of instances and prevents customers from over-running SG rules or ENI limits.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Security Group Referencing on TGW is available in all AWS Regions where Transit Gateway is available. You can enable this feature using the AWS Management Console, Amazon Command Line Interface, and the Amazon Software Development Kit. There is no additional charge for using Security Group Referencing on TGW. For more information, see the AWS Transit Gateway &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/pricing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/working-with-transit-gateways.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can now connect directly to the AWS Serverless Application Repository using AWS PrivateLink in your virtual private cloud (VPC) instead of connecting over the internet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When you use an AWS PrivateLink, communication between your VPC and AWS Serverless Application Repository is conducted entirely within the AWS network, which can provide greater security and protect your sensitive information. An AWS PrivateLink endpoint connects your VPC directly to AWS Serverless Application Repository. The instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to communicate with the AWS Serverless Application Repository API. To use AWS Serverless Application Repository through your VPC, you have two options. One is to connect from an instance that is inside your VPC. The other is to connect your private network to your VPC by using an AWS VPN option or AWS Direct Connect. You can create an AWS PrivateLink to connect to AWS Serverless Application Repository using the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Creating an Interface Endpoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; AWS Serverless Application Repository support for AWS PrivateLink is available in all &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS regions&lt;/a&gt; where AWS Serverless Application Repository is available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Notification Service&lt;/a&gt; (SNS) announces integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/end-user-messaging&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS End User Messaging&lt;/a&gt; for the delivery of SMS messages. Starting today, SNS customers can start using new features like SMS resource management, two-way messaging, granular resource permissions, country block rules, and centralized billing for all AWS SMS messaging without making any changes to configurations or the global AWS SMS network used by SNS.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub service that provides one-to-many message delivery to various endpoints, including AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, Amazon Data Firehose, mobile devices via AWS End User Messaging and mobile push, as well as email. AWS End User Messaging’s SMS capabilities provide resilient and flexible APIs to deliver SMS at a global scale with capabilities like number fail-over with phone pools, multi-media messaging (MMS), and the SMS simulator.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If you already send SMS via Amazon SNS APIs, you do not need to take any action. Existing resources such as phone numbers or sender IDs that you own have been configured with the required permissions. You will need to grant Amazon SNS permission to send to any new phone number you request after September 24, 2024.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more, visit the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon SNS Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS End User Messaging SMS User Guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Customize your Amazon SageMaker model deployment software and driver versions</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-sagemaker-model-deployment-software-driver-versions/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now pick the software and driver versions used by the instances that best fits your needs when deploying models on SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker makes it easier to deploy ML models including foundation models (FMs) to make inference requests at the best price performance for any use case.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Previously, customers had to use preset software and driver versions defined by SageMaker on the managed instances behind an endpoint. Now customers can specify the “InferenceAmiVersion” parameter when configuring endpoints to select the combination of software and driver versions (such as Nvidia driver and CUDA version) that best meets their requirements. This allows you to tailor your hosting environment to meet your performance, compatibility, scalability, and operational requirements of your ML applications. By using this parameter, you can also downgrade and upgrade driver versions for your endpoints on your own schedule.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This feature is available in all regions where SageMaker is available. You can learn more about deploying model on SageMaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/deploy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and more about this feature in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_ProductionVariant.html#sagemaker-Type-ProductionVariant-InferenceAmiVersion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon S3 to apply a default minimum object size for S3 Lifecycle transition rules</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-s3-default-minimum-object-size-lifecycle-transition-rules</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3 is beginning to apply a default minimum object size of 128 KB for S3 Lifecycle transition rules to any S3 storage class. This change can help optimize your transition costs for datasets with many kilobyte-sized objects by reducing the number of transition requests. You can override this new default and customize the minimum object size for S3 Lifecycle transition rules to any value.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Using S3 Lifecycle filters, you can create custom rules to transition objects based on prefix, tags, and object sizes. While the object size filter for your existing S3 Lifecycle rules will not automatically change, this new default behavior will be applied to any new or modified S3 Lifecycle configuration.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This change does not impact objects that have already transitioned using S3 Lifecycle. We have started deploying this S3 Lifecycle default to all AWS Regions and deployment will complete in the coming days. To learn more, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;S3 User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon Time Sync Service supports Microsecond-Accurate Time in Malaysia and Ohio Regions</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-time-sync-service-microsecond-accurate-time-malaysia-ohio/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Time Sync Service now supports clock synchronization within microseconds of UTC on Amazon EC2 instances in the Asia Pacific (Malaysia) and US East (Ohio) regions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Built on Amazon's proven network infrastructure and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Nitro System&lt;/a&gt;, customers can now access local, GPS-disciplined reference clocks on supported EC2 instances. These clocks can be used to more easily order application events, measure 1-way network latency, increase distributed application transaction speed, and incorporate in-region and cross-region scalability features while also simultaneously simplifying technical designs. This capability is an improvement over many on-premises time solutions, and it is the first microsecond-range time service offered by any cloud provider. Additionally, you can audit your clock accuracy from your instance to measure and monitor the expected microsecond-range accuracy. Customers already using the Amazon Time Sync Service on supported instances will see improved clock accuracy automatically, without needing to adjust their AMI or NTP client settings. Customers can also use standard PTP clients and configure a new PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) to get the best accuracy possible. Both NTP and PTP can be used without needing any updates to VPC configurations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amazon Time Sync’s microsecond-accurate time is available starting today in US East (Ohio), Asia Pacific (Malaysia), as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configure-ec2-ntp.html#connect-to-the-ptp-hardware-clock&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;additional regions on supported EC2 instance types&lt;/a&gt;. We will be expanding support to more AWS Regions. There is no additional charge for using this service.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Configuration instructions, and more information on the Amazon Time Sync Service, are available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EC2 User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS Lambda adds support for Amazon Linux 2023 runtimes in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/aws-lambda-linux-2023-runtimes-govcloud-regions/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Lambda now supports Amazon Linux 2023 runtimes in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This includes the following runtimes: Python 3.12, Node.js 20, Java 21, .NET 8, Ruby 3.3, and Amazon Linux 2023 (provided.al2023). Each runtime is available as both a managed runtime and a container base image. We will automatically apply updates to each managed runtime and container base image, as they become available.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This release includes the latest version of each programming language supported by Lambda, providing access to the latest programming language features and performance improvements. Built on Amazon Linux 2023, these runtimes provide a significantly smaller deployment footprint than earlier Amazon Linux 2-based runtimes, updated versions of common libraries such as glibc, and a new package manager.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To deploy Lambda functions using these new runtimes, upload the code through the Lambda console and select the runtime. You can also use the AWS CLI, AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), and AWS CloudFormation to deploy and manage your serverless applications. Additionally, you can also use the container base images to build and deploy functions as a container image. To migrate existing Lambda functions running earlier language versions, review your code for compatibility with the new language version, then re-build and re-deploy your function to use the new runtime.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt; for more information about AWS Lambda or sign in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda console&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/aws-deadline-cloud-sort-fields-steps-tasks-workers/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Deadline Cloud now supports the ability to sort on additional columns within step, task, and worker data, and filter tasks by status. This feature enables users to quickly find and organize data about their job submissions to their Deadline Cloud render farm.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Customers operating a render farm will often have hundreds of jobs running simultaneously. When users need to identify issues and take action, it is critical to view information related to the steps and tasks within a job quickly and easily. Having the ability to filter and sort step, task, and worker information helps to navigate data efficiently.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; These sort and filter capabilities are supported in all &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Deadline Cloud is available.

			<title>AWS CloudFormation Git sync now supports pull request workflows to review your stack changes</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/aws-cloudformation-git-sync-supports-pull-request-workflows</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/git-sync.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS CloudFormation Git sync&lt;/a&gt; now allows you to review your stack changes via Pull Request (PR) comments before they are deployed to CloudFormation. With this launch, you get a clear overview of the changes in your deployments within the PR. CloudFormation Git sync will automatically post the change set information as comments to each new PR created or updated in your repository. You are able to review the proposed changes and then deploy the changes by merging the PR.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt; allows you to use a template file to manage the configuration of your resources as a stack. Using Git sync, you can store this template in a remote Git repository and have your CloudFormation stacks automatically updated. CloudFormation monitors your Git repository and triggers a change set deployment whenever it detects a change in any template file that defines a stack, and/or a stack deployment file that contains parameters that configure the stack. With this launch, you can catch and prevent undesired changes from being deployed through a PR review of the change. You can enable this feature from either the console or CLI.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This feature is available in the following regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Paris), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Milan), Europe (Stockholm), and South America (São Paulo).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/git-sync.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/automate-safe-aws-cloudformation-deployments-from-github/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launch blog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS CodePipeline introduces pipeline variable check rule for stage level condition</title>
			<link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/aws-codepipeline-pipeline-variable-check-rule-stage-level-condition</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;AWS CodePipeline V2 type pipelines introduces pipeline variable check as a new rule that customers can use in their stage level condition to gate a pipeline execution. You can use this rule with any condition that is evaluated before entering the stage, before exiting a stage - when all actions in the stage have completed successfully, or when any action in the stage has failed. With the variable check rule, you can evaluate a pipeline parameter or an output variable from a prior action in the pipeline against a threshold, to determine if the condition will succeed or fail. For example, you can check if an output variable from a CodeBuild action is a certain value to determine if the pipeline execution should enter a stage.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To learn more about using the variable check rule in stage level conditions in your pipeline, visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/rule-reference-VariableCheck.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. For more information about AWS CodePipeline, visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;. The stage level conditions feature is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all regions &lt;/a&gt;where AWS CodePipeline is supported.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
